# ForTests
So, "ForTests", huh? What a dumb name for a repo, one might say. However, I will not agree with this grumbling motherfucker. This is indeed a repo where I test everything â€“ being a newbie here on GitHub, everything seems to be so fascinating! I gotta learn how to use this service, that's why I've created this repo and that's why I am typing this placeholder text right now. 

At the moment, my "ForTests" repo looks like a junk yard, but that's only because I yet don't know how to create folders. I have indeed downloaded the GitHub Desktop app, but still no luck in sucessfully uploading at least the projects I am working on right now.

Anyway, I gotta go now (it's not true, I will get back to coding, I am just running out of ideas of what to write here to make my starter page look a little bit better than it was). Bye, and thank's for reading!
